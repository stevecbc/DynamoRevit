## In Depth
This node displays the results of the sun analysisâ€™ unique identification value.

In this example, we gather all Forma elements, select the "proposal" and "site limits" categories, and use them as inputs to run the sun analysis.  The Sun.Id node evaluates the analysis results and extracts the unique ID for the sun analysis. Each analysis has its own distinct ID.
