## In Depth
This node provides the results of sun exposure based on a grid system.

In this example, we gather all Forma elements, select the "proposal" and "site limits" categories, and use them as inputs to run the sun analysis.  The ground results are extracted and used as input for the SunGround.Grid node.  This node output values based on sun exposure within a cartesian grid system (a grid made of squares).
