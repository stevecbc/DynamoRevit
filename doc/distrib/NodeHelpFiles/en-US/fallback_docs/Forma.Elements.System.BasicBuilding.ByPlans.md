## In Depth
This node creates a building element given a site, plan (FloorPlan), floorHeihts and coordinateSystem.  

In this example, number sliders create a rectangle that serves as an input to generate a Unit. The resulting Unit output is converted into a floor plan, which is then used as an input along with a site, floorHeights and a coordinateSystem, to generate a building using BasicBuildingByPlan and then sent to Forma.
