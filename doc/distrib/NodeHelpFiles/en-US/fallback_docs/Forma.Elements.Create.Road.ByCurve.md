## In Depth
This node creates a road based on a curve (poly curve) and a site input.  All other inputs have default values for, speed, adt, adtDayPercentage, adtEveningPercentage, adtNightPercentage and heavyVehiclePercentage.

In this example two number sliders are used to create two points that create a poly curve as an input to the Road.ByCurve node along with site, speed, adt (annual average daily traffic), adtDayPercentage (percent of traffic during the day), adtEveningPercentage (percent of traffic during the evening), adtNightPercentage (percent of traffic during the night) and heavyVehiclePercentage (percent of the traffic which is heavy vehicles).
