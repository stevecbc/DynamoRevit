## In Depth
This node defines the resolution (distance between sample points in meters) of a given sun analysis.

In this example, we gather all Forma elements, select the "proposal" and "site limits" categories, and use them as inputs to run the sun analysis.  The ground results are extracted and used as input for the SunGround.Resolution node. This node outputs the metric value between each analysis point.

For additional information on sun analysis see link below.
