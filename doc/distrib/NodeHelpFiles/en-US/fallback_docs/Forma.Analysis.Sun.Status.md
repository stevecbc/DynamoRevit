## In Depth
This node, Sun.Status, reports if a sun analysis process has SUCCEEDED or FAILED.

In this example, we gather all Forma elements, select the "proposal" and "site limits" categories, and use them as inputs to run the sun analysis. The Sun.Status node then evaluates the analysis results to provide a final status. This output tells you whether you can trust the analysis data.
