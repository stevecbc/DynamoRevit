## In Depth
This node evaluates the ground results of the sun analysis.

In this example, we gather all Forma elements, select the "proposal" and "site limits" categories, and use them as inputs to run the sun analysis.  The Sun.GroundResult node takes the analysis output and isolates the results for the ground, which are then displayed.

For additional information on sun analysis see link below.
