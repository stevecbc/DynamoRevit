## In Depth
This node creates a constraint (Transparent envelopes defining maximum allowable building volumes).

In this example a rectangle is formed using two number sliders, input into the ByClosedCurve node along with the Get Site and a height.  The last node sends the element to Forma so it can be viewed.  A constraint is a transparent envelope defining maximum allowable building volumes (e.g., for zoning). Found in the Limits tool group.
