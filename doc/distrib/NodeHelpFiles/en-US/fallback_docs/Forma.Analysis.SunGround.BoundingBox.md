## In Depth
This node defines a BoundingBox based off a given sunGround input.

In this example, we gather all Forma elements, select the "proposal" and "site limits" categories, and use them as inputs to run the sun analysis.  The ground results are extracted and used as input for the SunGround.BoundingBox node.  This node outputs the location of a bounding box given the SunGround location.  

For additional information on sun analysis see link below.
