## In Depth
The BasicBuilding.ByUnits converts units into FloorPlans.  These can then be used an inputs to other nodes.

In this example, number sliders create a rectangle that serves as an input to generate a Unit. The resulting Unit output is converted into a floor plan by BasicBuilding.ByUnits node, which is then used to generate a BasicBuildingByPlan element and sent to Forma.
